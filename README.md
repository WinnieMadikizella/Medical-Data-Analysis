## 🔍 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation in Excel

To ensure a structured and reliable analysis, the dataset was cleaned and organized using **Excel Power Query** and **Power Pivot**:

1. Standardized text fields and formatted data types.
2. Added categorized columns:
   - Age Groups: `0–18`, `19–35`, `36–50`, `51–65`, `66+`
   - Treatment Duration Categories: `Short`, `Medium`, `Long`
   - Treatment Cost Categories: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`
   - Seasons: Derived from the visit date column
3. Built a data model with dimension and fact tables.
4. Power Pivot Enhancements:
   - Satisfaction Category: Grouped patient ratings into `Low`, `Medium`, and `High`.
   - Insurance Coverage Category: Grouped coverage levels into `Low`, `Moderate`, `Partial`, and `High`.
5. Established relationships for seamless data integration.
